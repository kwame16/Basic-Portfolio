    <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>My name is Darius Mcphatter welcome to my first webpage design I'm currently enrolled in Rutgers Coding Bootcamp.
            I'm currently 28 years old with a landscaping business, a partnership with uber, and a mobile DJ.
            I completed college six years ago at Johnson & Wales University with an Associates degree in CADD and Bachelor's degree in Enginering Design.
            I like to believe that I picked up a minor in Culinary also because I lived with Culinary students for three of the four years off campus.
            I'm currently enrolled in this program so that I can learn some new skills and have a career change.
        </p>
