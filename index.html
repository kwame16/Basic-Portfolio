    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>My name is Darius McPhatter, welcome to my first webpage design. I'm currently enrolled in Rutgers Coding Bootcamp. 
    I'm 28 years old with a landscaping business, a partnership with uber, and a mobile DJ. 
    I completed college six years ago at Johnson & Wales University with an Associates degree in CADD and Bachelor's degree in Enginering Design. 
    I like to believe that I picked up a minor in Culinary also because I lived with Culinary students for three of the four years off campus. 
    I'm currently enrolled in this program so that I can learn some new skills and have a career change.</p>
